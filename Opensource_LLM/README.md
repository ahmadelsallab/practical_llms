# Experimenting with OpenSource LLMs

This section is dedicated to exploring a range of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs). The course is divided into two main parts: interacting with cloud-based LLMs and running LLMs locally. Participants will gain hands-on experience with various models, understand their capabilities, and learn to integrate them into applications.

## Part 1: Opensource LLMs in Cloud

### Overview
- **Objective**: Understand and interact with different cloud-based open-source LLMs.
- **Method**: Using Replicate API and Hugging Face for querying models like Llama, Llama2, Falcon, Mixtral, and others.

### Streamlit Interfaces for Cloud-based LLMs
- **Llama Models**: Build a Streamlit interface to interact with Llama models.
- **Falcon and Mixtral**: Create similar interfaces for Falcon and Mixtral models.
- **Comprehensive UI**: Develop a Streamlit app with a dropdown menu to evaluate different models, allowing for comparative analysis.

## Part 2: Opensource LLMs Locally

### Overview
- **Objective**: Set up and experiment with local LLMs, focusing on practical applications and interface building.
- **Method**: Utilize gpt4all and Python for local LLM interactions.

### Local LLM Experiments
- **GPT4All GUI**: Download, set up, and use the gpt4all GUI for local model evaluation.
- **Python Queries to gpt4all**: Learn to interact with gpt4all using Python scripts.
- **Streamlit Clone of gpt4all**: Build a Streamlit-based clone of gpt4all, replicating its functionalities and user interface.

## Learning Objectives
- Gain practical experience with various open-source LLMs.
- Understand the differences and capabilities of cloud-based and local LLMs.
- Develop skills in building user interfaces with Streamlit for model interaction.
- Learn to evaluate and compare the performance of different LLMs.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Python and API interactions.
- Familiarity with Streamlit and its components.
- Understanding of LLMs and their applications.

## Getting Started
Start with the cloud-based LLMs, setting up and experimenting with the Streamlit interfaces. Then, move to the local setup with gpt4all and explore its capabilities. Follow the instructions and documentation provided for each model and tool.
